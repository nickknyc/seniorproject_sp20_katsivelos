This semester there are four different sections of senior project. Please be aware that you may be switched into another section depending on your area of interest and whether or not you elect to have a team senior project. Teams will be placed in the same section if at all possible. All of the sections are being held at the same time so the switch will not affect your schedule at all. We will try to balance the sections according to the following but we may not be able to accommodate all students depending on various factors. If you are working on the following types of projects you will most likely be placed in that instructor's section: 
* design or audio project (Duff)
* XR/AR/VR (Gannis)
* Physical Computing (Nathanson)
* Creative Technology / Entrepreneurship (Katsivelos)

## Welcome to Senior Project In Digital Media!

**What is Senior Project in Digital Media?** Senior Project in Digital Media is the capstone course for the Integrated Digital Media (IDM) program. This course mirrors the creative process that professional artists, designers, creative technologists, and entrepreneurs must practice throughout their entire careers. In order to succeed, this course requires you to devote a lot of time and effort outside of class, throughout the entire semester.

The primary goal for the student is to develop a hunger and passion for self-directed, life-long learning and creativity. To achieve this students will involve themselves in a semester-long capstone project that includes a robust investigation of all phases of the creative process, including research, design, development, and user testing for the production of a substantial and mature body of work, representing their creative and conceptual skills as artists, designers, creative technologists, and/or entrepreneurs.

As you engage in the rigorous practice of a professional artist, designer, or entrepreneur, your project will naturally evolve and change, and may in fact take quite a different shape than what you propose in the beginning of the semester. This is normal and OK.

The Senior Project can take many forms, including but not limited to the following:

* a screen-based, digital application (website, mobile app, game, etc.)
* a physical object, musical instrument, physical game, or interactive installation
* a performance or event,
* a moving image (animation, film, motion graphics, video web series, etc.)
* audio (podcast, etc.)
* print medium

The Senior Project **can also be a team-based project** if your teammate is also taking Senior Project in any section this semester.


## Your Commitment to Senior Project
Excerpt from the book *Anything You Want* by Derek Sivers

     No “yes.” 
     Either “HELL YEAH!” or “no.”
     If you’re not saying “HELL YEAH!” about something, say “no.” 
     When deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less than 
     “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!”
     —then say “no.” 

How are you currently feeling about your Senior Project? 
* Yes. 
* Hell Yeah! or 
* No:( 

If you are NOT feeling “Hell Yeah!” about your senior project, remember your project idea is just that YOURS. I highly suggest you read "What is Senior Project in Digital Media?", again, AND the required and recommended readings NOW!

Senior Project is about the work YOU are and will continue to do, when you are no longer a student. You don’t need anyone to whip you to work because you can NOT, not do it. You will live, eat, breath, and sleep with this project. It is NOT about doing a project for a class or pleasing the IDM faculty. It is about you, your ideas, your concerns, your questions and your passion.

Senior Project in Digital Media is about demonstrating the maturity, responsibility, and integrity to manage your practice/research/investigation, while having the luxury of constructive critique and feedback from your fellow classmates, faculty, and outside critics. Ultimately, your goal is to COMPLETE a project that has a life beyond school, beyond graduation.


### Program Goals

The following IDM program goals are reinforced within this course. Students will:

* develop **conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
  * Students will develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
* develop **technical skills** to realize their ideas.
  * Students will understand and utilize tools and technology, while adapting to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn.
  * Students will be able to integrate/interface different technologies within a technological ecosystem.
* develop **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.


### Course Goals

This course will help students to:
* determine, communicate, and accomplish your own vision and goals for your senior project. 
* practice an iterative design process in conjunction with effective project & time management skills.
* continue to hone all aspects of professional communication about your creative process and work through discourse, presentations, and writing.


### Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to develop, complete, and document a body of work that is meaningful and carefully crafted to be used for professional purposes (employment, gallery shows, starting a business, etc.).


### Course Structure

Students are expected to be on time for all meetings, critiques, and presentations. 

This class will consist of 
* **Individual Meetings**
Be prepared to present and discuss your work at your appointed time. Students should plan ahead and ensure that technical requirements necessary for the review of work are addressed *prior* to meeting with the instructor. Also, have any required documents ready, as well.

    Individual meetings are not optional. They are important and useful. Sometimes they are most useful exactly when you feel you have nothing to talk about or show. It is normal that you may sometimes have nothing "good" to show, or even nothing at all. It is still important that you keep your appointment so that we can talk about that. If for some unusual reason you cannot make your appointment one week, please swap times with a classmate.

* **Class critiques**

     Each presentation will consist of 
     * 10 minutes of presentation and 
     * 10 minutes of critique 
     (or a combination thereof)
     for 20 minutes total. 

    It is the responsibility of each senior to invite an outside critic to at least one of their project critiques. “Outside” might mean a faculty member from IDM, another NYU school or program, or another university altogether, a mentor from the professional world, an expert in your area of research, etc. A one on one, <strong>documented</strong> meeting (date, time, length, and typed notes) with the outside critic can substitute for their presence at a project critique. Also, have the outside critic email me to confirm that they actually met with you.

    Critiques (AKA crits) are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. During the crit, the professor and your classmates analyze and suggest ways to increase the aural, visual, and conceptual impact of each existing idea. Have at least your accountability partner or another classmate take notes for you when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project. 

    Rules of the Critique:
    * Be Present and Engaged (i.e. Close your laptops and stow your cellphones).
    * Give Feedback to your classmates. 
    * Do not make assumptions. Ask questions.
    * Do your best.
    * Do NOT take feedback personally.

Students will conduct **self assessments** as well as be evaluated by the professor during or after midterm and at the end of the semester. Any action without reflection is meaningless. Real learning only occurs as part of a reflective process. Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything. It involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something.

* Have patience, persistence, and discipline 
* Be creative
* Have self-confidence and pride in your work


### Evaluation & Grading

##### Attendance

* Attendance is mandatory during project critiques and every student’s end of semester public presentations. 
* Missed individual meetings will not be rescheduled; Make every effort to swap your timeslot with another student. Otherwise, students will have to wait for their next assigned meeting time if you do not attend or swap your timeslot.
* In the event a student has little or no progress to show, he/she is still required to attend class.
* Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One absence is allowed; after that, your final, overall, numerical grade will drop by 5 percent (1/2 a grade point (e.g. A to an A-)) for each additional absence.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes of tardiness, your final, numerical grade will drop by 0.625 percent
* Contact the professor IN ADVANCE if you will not be in class (in person or by email is preferred).

#### Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative & qualitative rubrics:

### Technology Use In The Classroom

Laptop computers and other mobile devices are invaluable tools for students when used responsibly. However, this technology can also be incredibly distracting in the classroom. When in class, you may use your laptops and other devices for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, making class presentations, etc. However, the following uses are unacceptable: checking email, instant messaging, texting, using social networking sites such as facebook, instagram, twitter, etc. **When your classmates are presenting, please close your laptops and turn off your cell phones.**


### Academic Honesty

Please review <a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/code-of-conduct/academic-dishonesty" target="_blank">NYU's School of Engineering's academic dishonesty policy</a> in its entirety.

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA or Chicago Manual style for citing and documenting source material.

You MUST have complete rights of use to any and all materials which appear in your senior projects. This includes images, illustrations, audio etc. The source of any materials NOT created by you MUST be documented. Please remember that you can collaborate with other students to create your own media or contact the authors of your media selections for rights. I strongly encourage you to use original media for your senior projects, however should you absolutely require to use stock images, video, etc., you will need to provide a PDF of all source files and the usage rights you have purchased/negotiated or whether it is creative commons or copyright free.
