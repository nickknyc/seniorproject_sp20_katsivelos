**Break down** EVERYTHING you need to do for **your project into actionable tasks** using [Personal Kanban](http://personalkanban.com/pk/personal-kanban-101/). All actionable tasks should start with a verb \(i.e. write, call, email, build, collect, etc.\).

I recommend using an analog, digital or analog/digital combination.

* post-it notes on a wall or mini ones in a notebook \(so you can move them around\) or
* a digital representation of your milestones using [kanbanery.com](http://kanbanery.com) or another digital platform of your choice.

The columns I recommend for Personal Kanban \(but you are not limited to\) are:

* To-Do
* Today \(Work-In-Progress \(WIP\) limit of 3 to 5 maximum\)
* Waiting For \(OPTIONAL\)
* Done

If you use Kanbanery.com, please go to **Settings**, and under **General Settings** **enable** a _public URL_ and make sure you press **Update** at the bottom of the General Settings page. Then, copy and paste your public URL to slack as a comment to the specific kanbanery.com message.
