## Recommended Audio Podcasts

* [Revision Path](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/revision-path/id834173190?mt=2) Maurice Cherry interviews designers, developers, and other creators of color weekly.
* [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-tim-ferriss-show/id863897795?mt=2) Tim Ferriss deconstructs world-class performers from eclectic areas \(investing, sports, business, art, etc.\) to extract the tactics, tools, and routines you can use. This includes favorite books, morning routines, exercise habits, time-management tricks, and much more.
  * I suggest listening to Derek Sivers, Debbie Millman, and David Heinemeier Hansson
* [Unmistakeable Creative](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/unmistakable-creative/id352721366?mt=2) Srini Rao interviews instigators, rebels, and people with a pathological inability to accept the status quo.

* [State of the Art](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/state-of-the-art/id1305467447?mt=2)
* [StartUp Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/startup-podcast/id913805339?mt=2) StartUp is a podcast series about what it’s really like to get a business off the ground.
  * In Season 1, Alex Blumberg told the story of launching this business, Gimlet Media, a podcast network.
  * In Season 2, Lisa Chow joined Alex to follow an entirely new company: a company called Dating Ring, founded by two women in their 20s, outsiders in the male-dominated world of Silicon Valley.
  * In Season 3, rather than following one company over many episodes, they are telling stories about many companies that all have something in common: their companies are stuck, and they know they need to make a big change.

## Time Management & Productivity Resources

_Tools_

Hope these resources help. They've helped me, but the secret is discipline, focus, and prioritizing \(which requires not doing something else\). No system is a magic cure. A system only works if you use it daily.
