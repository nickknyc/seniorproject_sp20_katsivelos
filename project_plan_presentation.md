## Project Plan Presentation

* Use the [project plan](plan.md) sections as a template for your visual presentation. The project plan is just a guideline for information for your presentation. It is up to you to decide which areas you want to focus on. In other words, how many slide(s) will you devote to each section. In some cases, you might omit a section if you think the class remembers key ideas from your previous presentation.
* Use google slides and the [pecha kucha](pecha_kucha.md) (20 slides x 20 sec) format. 
* Export your presentation as a pdf and post in your project documentation folder for your [end of semester deliverables](end_of_semester_deliverables.md).

Each presentation will consist of 
* 7 minutes of presentation and 
* 7 minutes of Q&A 
(or a combination thereof)
for 14 minutes total. 

### Invite guests
It is the responsibility of each senior to invite an outside critic to *at least* one of their project critiques, demos, or presentations. “Outside” might mean a faculty member from IDM, another NYU college, or another university altogether, a mentor from the professional world, an expert in your area of research, etc. A one on one, documented meeting (date, time, length, and typed notes) with the outside critic can substitute for their presence at a project critique. Also, have the outside critic email me to confirm that they actually met with you. Document the feedback that you receive on your [process website](website.md).

### Document your feedback
Always document any feedback you receive on your [process website](website.md) after any critique. This critique feedback post should include images of the current status of your project (prototype or version), a description of your project progress as it currently stands and discussion of the feedback your received from the critique. How will this feedback improve your work and ideas?
