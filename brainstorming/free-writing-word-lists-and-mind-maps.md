# Free Writing, Word Lists & Mind Maps

**Freewriting** is similar to journal writing but it focuses on a specific idea or question instead of writing about general thoughts and feelings.

**Word Lists** are a great way to rapidly go through any words that come to mind when you're brainstorming a particular idea. There are many wordlist generators online.

**Mind Maps** are great when you're trying to get an exhaustive overview of everything you know about a particular topic. Afterward, you can identify any holes in your topic or decide to focus on a particular area.
