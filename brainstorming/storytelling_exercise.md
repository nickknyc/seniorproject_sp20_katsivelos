# Storytelling Exercise

## Audio \(Optional\) / Visual \(Required\) Storytelling Exercise

* Please note that this is an optional exercise for brainstorming.
* Please name your file as lastname\_senior\_sp20\_storytelling.pdf
* Use google slides and the [pecha kucha](../pre-work/pecha_kucha.md) \(20 slides x 20 sec\) format. 
* Export as a pdf and upload to your project documentation folder for your [end of semester deliverables](../end_of_semester_deliverables/).

Select 20 images that create a visual story about your project idea \(no text\). One image per screen. Be prepared to talk **briefly** about each image you select \(20 seconds goes by fast\).

There are two options:

* If you already have a project idea, this audio \(optional\), visual \(required\) presentation should cover all perspectives, concepts and ideas you can think about. Don’t limit yourself but broaden up.
* If you do not have a specific project, select 20 things that you consider relevant for living in 2020 or 20 things that you are interested in.
