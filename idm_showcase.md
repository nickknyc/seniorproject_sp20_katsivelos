## IDM Showcase   

May TBD, Time TBD, 370 Jay Rm TBD (Attendance is MANDATORY for the entire # hours!)

Your senior project will be publicly shown in the IDM showcase at the end of the semester (date to be determined). Exhibiting your work is truly a gift of accomplishment, response, and feedback. 

* **Show Your Work:** Your project should be as complete as humanly possible. You will exhibit your senior project publicly in the IDM Showcase. If you don't understand the importance and benefits of exhibiting your work, I HIGHLY recommend that you read [Show Your Work!](http://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Creativity-Discovered-ebook/dp/B00GU2RGGI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420589663&sr=8-1&keywords=show+the+work+austin+kleon) by Austin Kleon NOW ([Cheat Sheet](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1384352860i/6856374._SY540_.jpg).

* **Network:** For professional engagement, include your senior project on your portfolio website. You should also consider displaying your project process website as well, as well as having business or post cards and copies of your resume handy. 

* **Document Your Work and Feedback:** 
* Take photos and/or videos of your exhibition, as well as document audience feedback, and upload to your project documentation folder for your [end of semester deliverables](end_of_semester_presentation.md).
